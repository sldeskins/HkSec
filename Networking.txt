Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
Domain Name Server (DNS)


Components:
End-User device
Local Area Networks (LAN)
Router (physical device) / Gateway (logical)
Firewall


Media Access Control (MAC)

Network Address Translation (NAT)

Customer Premise Equipment (CPE)  ISP CPE router


Troubleshooting Steps:
----------------------
- Define the problem
- Isolate the Network layer
- Isolate the scope
- Isolate the cause


Define the problem
===========================
Asked what's going on?
Ask if can access internal sites.
Ask if can access external sites.


Isolating the Network Layer
===========================
Open System Interconnection (OSI) Model
 
 1. Physical
		Is the network cable plugged in?
		Does the network interface card (NIC) have a link light?
		
 2. Data link
		Is the IP and netmask configured properly?
		ipconfig
		
		Are other devices on the LAN reachable via Layer 2?
		ping 10.10.1.255
		
		Does it respond to an ARP requests?
		arp -a
	
 3. Network
		Is the packect getting drop?
		ping 
		tracert plurasight.com
		pathping
	
 4. Transport
		Is the correct port being used?
		Is the port open and responding?
		telnet
		nmap
 
 5. Session
 6. Presentation
 7. Application

 
 
 Isolating the Scope
 ===================
 Are you the only one effected?
 When was the last time you were able to access?
 
 Isolating the Cause
 ===================
 
 Formulate a Theory 
 
 
 
 
 
 Static Routing 
 Open Shorted Path First(OSPF)
 Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
 
 
 Example using IE and Windows
 ----------------------------
 Control Panel -> network sharing
 
 Local Area Connection  - check this out first
	Then properties -> ip4 properties for the gateway
	Go to command prompt and ping the gateway
	
	
	
	ipconfig /all
	
	ipconfig /release
	ipconfig /renew
	
	
	
	arp -d
	
	
	nop arp in ip6
	
	netsh
	netsh>interface ipv6
	netsh>interface ipv6>show neighbors     //ipv6 equivalent of arp
	netsh>interface ipv6>delete neighbors     //ipv6 equivalent of arp -d
	
	netsh>interface ipv6>set interface "Local Area Connection" routerdiscovery=disable     // 
	
	
	 
	
	Ports are associated with an Application
	----------------------------------------
	
	Telent:
	Windows machine 
	control panel-> programs and features -> turn windows features on/off -> telnet client check box
	>telnet intranet.netluxia.com 443        //443 tcp
	>telnet intranet.netluxia.com 80         //80 http
	
	
	-----------------------------
	Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
	
	SSL replaced by TLS Level 5 - Session
	HTTPS - Level 7 - Application
	
	
	
	nslookup 
	>intranet.netluxia.com
	>exit
	
	
	checking out latency
	----------------------
	arp -a
	tracert - d intranet.netluxia.com
	netstat -n
