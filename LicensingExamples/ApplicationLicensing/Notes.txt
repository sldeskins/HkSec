Registry-Based Licensing

Registry-Based licensing implements a licensing scheme that checks for the 
presence of a specific Registry key that contains a specific value. The 
application itself implements no code to write the Registry value--that 
must be done by the installation application, and since most applications 
use the Registry anyway, this doesn't pose a significant development 
limitation. We've been pre-populating Registry keys with our installation 
applications ever since there was a Registry. 

I could, if I wanted, be cleverer regarding the value written to the Registry, but for this example I'll simply write the string "Installed." I'll leave the more clever implementations to you (hey, I can't give away all of my secrets!). The value I'll look for is this: 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Acme\HostKeys\2de915e1-df71-
3443-9f4d-32259c92ced2

To begin, we'll need to modify the source code for the main application in four places in addition to writing our own license provider. These four areas are: 
1.The application class declaration (to add some attributes)
2.The application class constructor
3.The application class Dispose() method
4.The application "main" method
